##How to create an admin
In order to use the application, admin accounts have to be created.

To create an admin account, perform the following steps:
1. Run the application.
2. Register as a company - Use your preferred admin login data.
3. Open the database (db.sqlite file in the backend folder of the application) with the sqlite DB browser of your choice (i.e. https://sqlitebrowser.org/).
4. Go to table 'user'. Note the "id" column of the user with the email you entered in step 2.
5. Go to table 'company'. Delete the row where column "userId" is equal to your noted id.
6. Go to table 'admin'. Add a new row. Insert the noted id into column "userId".
7. Write your changes to the database.
